# Deep Learning Codebase using PyTorch

## Introduction

This is my code base for rapid prototyping and developing quick deep learning solutions.

## Features

Currently this repo supports only classification using feed-forward neural nets.
All hyperparameters are expected to be input using a param.json file.

TODO
1. Add Recurrent and Conv Nets
2. Neural architecture search for automated discovery of hyperparameters
